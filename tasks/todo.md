# The Starry Night — plan of record

Durable cross-session plan. `tasks/lessons.md` holds the memory; this holds the intent.
Locked sections in CLAUDE.md are Mark's. Proposed changes to them go under "Proposed to Mark"
below — never edited in place.

> **Human-facing record (Obsidian):** `~/File Vault/The Starry-night` — dashboard (`_Map`), Status
> (where we are), Sky evolution (visual journey), Concepts (glossary), Timeline. The repo files here
> stay the source of truth; the vault is the navigable layer over them. At session start, read
> `tasks/lessons.md`; the vault's `Status` note mirrors the current state for a quick human catch-up.

## Phase 0 — reference pipeline  (active; gate: Mark reviews captures at the end)

- [x] Fetch standard-high-res public-domain scan → `reference/starry-night-source.jpg` (3840×3041)
- [x] `scripts/derive-reference.ts` — dependency-free pipeline (`sips` + Node `zlib`)
  - [x] decode source, compute luminance
  - [x] structure-tensor orientation + coherence (Gaussian-smoothed, energy-gated)
  - [x] encode `public/reference/flow-field.png` (double-angle orientation + coherence)
  - [x] region palettes → `public/reference/palette.json` (median-cut, sRGB + Lab)
  - [x] gate captures → `reference/derived/` (flow LIC, colourised overlay, coherence map)
- [x] Self-review captures against the painting; retune (1 pass: gated coherence + cypress filter)
- [x] `docs/decisions/0001-reference-pipeline.md` — source, method, params, encodings
- [x] Commit; **stop at Phase 0 gate** and present to Mark ← awaiting Mark's review

## Phase 1 — movable definition  (active; settled by building, not discussing)

Spikes share a scene foundation; the hybrid subsumes the other two, so build components and
compose them, judging the feel at each step. Gate: Mark reviews captures (the movable decision).

- [x] Slice 1 — scene foundation: painting plane, cover-framed, true colour. Desktop ✓.
      Mobile portrait cover-crops the moon/cypress → portrait framing deferred to Slice 5.
- [x] Slice 2 — brushstroke sky (static): instanced strokes oriented by the flow field, tinted
      from the painting; orientation confirmed against the brushwork
- [x] Slice 3 — brushstroke sky (churning): advect strokes along the flow — reads as Van Gogh's
      sky moving; sky-only placement + relief brush keep it faithful
- [x] Slice 4 — cypress parallax (masked cutout) + constrained pan/tilt camera (±15° yaw,
      ±10° pitch). Hybrid confirmed. (Village/steeple/hills layers → "foreground complete" gate.)
- [x] Judged the three readings; picked **hybrid**; `docs/decisions/0002-movable-definition.md`.
      **Phase 1 gate reached — awaiting Mark's review.**

## 3D rebuild — the sky (active, 2026-06-13 → 06-14)

Orbitable 3D diorama under an enveloping churning sky. The sky is the soul of the piece and is the
furthest along — past the **first full animated sky** in substance, now being polished to Mark's eye.

- [x] Real forms — lathe cypress, village + church + steeple, rolling hills, moonlit floating slab
- [x] Bloom for a luminous night
- [x] Native vortex-field sky — bold swirls, 360°, no seam / symmetry / gaps
- [x] Anchored to the painting — central double-swirl, Venus, the nine real stars + moon at their true
      positions, centred on the camera's view (`uvToFrontDir`, ~123° arc, camera-aligned basis)
- [x] Rolling swirls, not funnels — spiral inflow gives Van Gogh's logarithmic-spiral comma form
- [x] Glowing swirl eyes — sign-aware luminous cores; no dark drains, front and back
- [x] Dev playground — full leva panel (sky / sky colours / light & bloom); defaults = the tuned look
- [x] Swirls crisper under bloom — tighter bloom (threshold 0.6 / radius 0.55) + cross-stroke relief ridge
- [x] Smooth the cypress facets — centripetal-spline the lathe profile (no facets; smooth flame)
- [x] Moon is a glowing crescent, not a flat disc — additive gold halo + carved crescent sprites
- [x] Hybrid flow-field bias — front-arc strokes follow the painting's derived orientation (coherence-
      weighted, eyes protected); honours the locked bar L88. `flowBias` panel knob (default 0.6)
- [x] Palette contract (P1) — surfaces (cypress/hills/houses/roofs/slab/steeple) + dome gradient now
      sourced from `palette.json` via `src/scene/palette.ts`; strokes keep the painting's true colour,
      emissive lights stay warm. Honours the locked colour criterion.
- [x] Moon framing (P2) — nudged off the very corner (`MOON_UV` 0.80,0.20) so the crescent + halo clear
      the desktop frame

Open (Mark: "keep polishing"):
- [ ] Steeple reads a touch muted at the derived `#556c81` (was an invented lighter grey) — lift if you
      want the church spire to pop more (stay within palette tolerance)
- [ ] Tune `flowBias` strength (0.6 subtle → 1.0 more brushwork) and bake the chosen value
- [ ] Bake Mark's chosen leva values in as the new defaults once he's played with the panel
- [ ] Moon prominence is a taste call — current is a tasteful crescent; can blossom larger/brighter if Mark wants
      it nearer the painting's dominant corner-moon (widen the `moon` control range when baking defaults)

## Backlog / later gates (post movable-decision)

- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` dignified still state (locked criterion) — `paused` freezes the churn;
      verified static via `page.emulateMedia({reducedMotion})` (identical frames under reduce)
- [x] `npm run lint` clean — scoped R3F immutability disables + script-hygiene fixes
- [x] README refreshed from "scaffold" to the orbitable-diorama reality
- [ ] Mobile portrait framing — responsive fov now keeps the cypress edge + central whorl + steeple;
      the MOON still can't fit a portrait frame (≈42° off-centre on the arc) → needs a portrait-specific
      camera bearing (Mark's composition call). Plus stroke budget + DPR caps; perf on real mid-tier mobile
- [ ] Ship hygiene: slim `flow-field.png` (3.2 MB); strip `leva` from the production build
- [ ] Gates remaining: **foreground complete** · **pre-release**

## Parked ideas (scope-growth — do NOT build without Mark)

- (none yet)

## Proposed to Mark (changes to locked sections — Mark applies)

- CLAUDE.md L27 names "Fable 5" as the autonomous operator; the operator this session is
  Opus 4.8. Reconcile the wording if desired — operating contract is unaffected either way.
- **2026-06-13 — DIRECTION CHANGE (Mark's call): full 3D diorama.** Mark wants Starry Night as a
  real orbitable 3D world (techartist reference), not a flat painting + overlay. This relaxes two
  LOCKED items — please update when you're happy:
  - "Out of scope → Free-orbit camera" — now in scope (constrained orbit, tasteful limits).
  - Acceptance criterion "Camera stays within pan/tilt limits; composition always reads as the
    painting" — needs rewording for an orbitable diorama.
  Kept: painterly impasto (the bar), flow-derived churn, palette fidelity. 0002 revised to suit.
- **2026-06-14 — flow-field reconciliation: RESOLVED → hybrid built (Mark's call).** The locked-bar
  gap (L88) is closed on the front: `SkyDome` now samples `flow-field.png` (coherence-weighted) to
  bias fine stroke orientation on the front arc — strongest between swirls, faded to zero at the eyes;
  vortices still own the macro composition + motion. `flow`/`sampleFlow` are live. Built as an A/B
  (`flowBias` panel knob, default 0.6; captures in `scratch/ab-{A,B}-{front,side,mobile}.jpeg`).
  - Open for Mark: **dial the bias strength** (0.6 is subtle-but-present; push toward 1.0 for more
    pronounced brushwork, or back off) and bake the chosen value as the default.
  - Still genuinely irreducible: the INVENTED BACK can't be flow-derived (a flat painting has no back)
    — that tension is documented and accepted; the bar is honoured where the painting actually exists.
    If you still want L88's wording to acknowledge the front-derived / back-invented split, that's a
    locked-section edit for you.
